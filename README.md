# hashmap-entry-ownable

Variation of `HashMap::entry()` that accepts borrowed forms of keys.

## Compatibility

This crate requires nightly version of Rust (see [`hash_raw_entry`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/56167)).

`entry_ownable()` can be used as a drop-in replacement for `entry()`, *unless*:

- `Entry::key()` is used,
- entry is matched as a enum (`Entry::Occupied`/`Entry::Vacant`).

## Description

Use this crate if you create/update a lot of entries from borrowed forms of keys (e.g. from `&str` instead of `String`):

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use hashmap_entry_ownable::EntryAPI;

let rhyme = vec![
	"Mary", "had", "a", "little", "lamb",
	"little", "lamb", "little", "lamb",
];

let mut words: HashMap<String, _> = HashMap::new();

for w in rhyme {
	// words.entry() accepts String but not &str
	// this version saves us 4 short-living allocations
	// for consecutive appearances of "little" and "lamb"
	let counter = words.entry_ownable(w).or_insert(0);
	*counter += 1;
}
```

This code can be emulated with `match map.get_mut(k)`/`map.insert(k.to_owned(), â€¦)`.
That too would be faster than regular Entry API if keys are reused a lot,
but `entry_ownable()` variant:

- is as concise as regular `entry()` one,
- only hashes key once, while `get_mut()`/`insert()` does it twice if key is not in the map.
